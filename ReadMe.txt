HackerU Full-Stack - Project #1 | [Idan Elimeleh]. 

The overall experience was fun and seamless, I enjoyed learning and interacting with the project.
I didn't encounter challenges yet but I know they're coming. 
Programming on any level is enjoyable for me, this is a good entry point to the industry in my opinion. 

The introduction course served it's purpose very well in offering an opportunity to see if it's a right fit. 
The experience was positive, informative and educational.
